HOW TO USE

Hello and welcome to Aurora! Aurora is the goddess of dawn, and we hope this site will be your dawn goddess, guiding you through the mornings as your plan your day. 

When you first open the application at https://web-emilywang.c9users.io/web/final.html , you have to change the https:// to http:// and turn CORS off and on. Then, you can enter in your name, zip code, and star sign. 

When you press “Go”, you will get to another page. The background color of the page changes depending on the time, as the time is used as a hex code. If you pay attention closely, every 10 seconds there is a slight change in color. The application will tell you what temperature and weather it is in your location, as well as a recommendation on what to wear. It will also tell you your daily horoscope. 

When you click “See Past Results”, you will see a page with a table of past uses.
